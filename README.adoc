PILAF (Paper Integration Layer for Automation Functions) is a comprehensive YAML story-driven testing framework specifically designed for PaperMC Minecraft plugin developers. It transforms complex Java integration tests into simple, readable YAML scenarios that enable automated testing of Minecraft plugin functionality.

== Purpose

Traditional Minecraft plugin testing requires extensive Java code to simulate player actions, execute server commands, and validate results. PILAF eliminates this complexity by providing a YAML-based story format that non-developers can understand and maintain.

**Instead of this:**
```java
// 150+ lines of complex Java integration test code
@Test
void testLightningAbility() throws Exception {
    // Setup player connection
    // Connect to Mineflayer bridge
    // Execute RCON commands
    // Simulate player actions
    // Wait for responses
    // Validate results
    // Clean up resources
}
```

**You write this:**
```yaml
# 34 lines of readable YAML
name: "Lightning Ability Test"
steps:
  - action: "execute_rcon_command"
    command: "summon zombie ~ ~5 ~ {CustomName:'\"TestTarget\"'}"
  - action: "execute_player_command"
    player: "test_player"
    command: "/ability 1"
  - action: "wait"
    duration: 2000
  - action: "get_entities_in_view"
    player: "test_player"
    store_as: "entities_after"
```

=== Core Components

1. **PilafCli**: Standalone command-line interface for running YAML stories
2. **YamlStoryParser**: Parses YAML stories into executable action sequences
3. **TestOrchestrator**: Coordinates execution between backends and state management
4. **Backend Interface**: Abstraction for different testing approaches (Mineflayer, RCON, Mock)
5. **State Management**: Variable storage, comparison, and JSON extraction capabilities
6. **Report Generator**: HTML reports with step-by-step execution logs and screenshots

== Prerequisites

=== System Requirements
- Java 21+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for full integration testing)
- Running PaperMC server or compatible Minecraft server

=== Service Dependencies
PILAF requires these services for full functionality:

1. **PaperMC Server** (localhost:25565)
2. **RCON Server** (localhost:25575)
3. **Mineflayer Bridge** (localhost:3000)

=== Docker Setup

Use the provided Docker Compose configuration for complete testing environment:

```bash
# Start the complete PILAF stack
docker-compose -f lib/pilaf/docker/docker-compose.pilaf.yml up -d
```

== Quick Start Guide

=== 1. One-Time Setup

Run the setup script to configure the complete PILAF ecosystem:

```bash
# From your plugin root directory
bash lib/pilaf/docker/setup-pilaf.sh
```

This creates:
- `pilaf.jar` - Standalone CLI
- `docker-compose.pilaf.yml` - Docker stack
- `pilaf.yaml` - Configuration file
- Convenience scripts (`start-pilaf-services.sh`, `run-pilaf-tests.sh`, etc.)

=== 2. Create Test Directory Structure

```
src/test/resources/
└── integration-stories/
    ├── lightning-ability-test.yaml
    ├── cooldown-behavior-test.yaml
    └── entity-removal-test.yaml
```

=== 3. Write Your First YAML Story

Create `src/test/resources/integration-stories/my-plugin-test.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "My Plugin Command Test"
description: "Test that /myplugin command works correctly"

setup:
  - action: "execute_rcon_command"
    command: "op test_player"
    name: "Make test player operator"

  - action: "give_item"
    player: "test_player"
    item: "diamond_sword"
    count: 1
    name: "Give test item"

steps:
  - action: "execute_player_command"
    player: "test_player"
    command: "/myplugin test"
    name: "Execute plugin command"

  - action: "wait"
    duration: 1000
    name: "Wait for command response"

  - action: "get_player_inventory"
    player: "test_player"
    store_as: "inventory_after"
    name: "Check inventory after command"

cleanup:
  - action: "execute_rcon_command"
    command: "deop test_player"
    name: "Remove operator privileges"
```

=== 4. Configure PILAF

Edit `pilaf.yaml`:

```yaml
# Backend Configuration
backend: "mineflayer"  # Options: mineflayer, rcon, mock

# Service Connection Settings
mineflayer_url: "http://localhost:3000"
rcon_host: "localhost"
rcon_port: 25575
rcon_password: "dragon123"

# Story Discovery
stories:
  - "src/test/resources/integration-stories/"  # Directory of integration tests
  - "src/test/resources/test-stories/"         # Directory of unit tests

# Reporting
report_directory: "target/pilaf-reports"
verbose: false

# Health Checks
skip_health_checks: false
```

=== 5. Run Your Tests

```bash
# Start services
./start-pilaf-services.sh

# Run tests
./run-pilaf-tests.sh

# Or use CLI directly
java -jar pilaf.jar --config=pilaf.yaml --verbose

# Health check
java -jar pilaf.jar --health-check
```

=== CLI Commands Reference

```bash
# Using config file
java -jar pilaf.jar --config=pilaf.yaml

# Using command line arguments
java -jar pilaf.jar \
  --stories=src/test/resources/integration-stories/ \
  --mineflayer-url=http://localhost:3000 \
  --verbose

# Run specific story files
java -jar pilaf.jar src/test/resources/integration-stories/lightning-ability-test.yaml

# Health check
java -jar pilaf.jar --health-check

# Help
java -jar pilaf.jar --help
```

== YAML Story Writing Guide

=== Story Structure

Every YAML story has three main sections:

```yaml
name: "Story Name"
description: "What this test validates"

setup:           # Actions that run before main test
  - action: "..."

steps:           # Main test execution
  - action: "..."

cleanup:         # Actions that run after test
  - action: "..."
```

=== Advanced Examples

#### State Comparison Workflow

```yaml
steps:
  # Capture entity state before action
  - action: "get_entities_in_view"
    player: "test_player"
    store_as: "entities_before"
    name: "Get entities before lightning"

  # Execute plugin action
  - action: "execute_player_command"
    player: "test_player"
    command: "/lightning strike"
    name: "Use lightning ability"

  # Wait for effect
  - action: "wait"
    duration: 2000
    name: "Wait for lightning processing"

  # Capture state after action
  - action: "get_entities_in_view"
    player: "test_player"
    store_as: "entities_after"
    name: "Get entities after lightning"

  # Compare states
  - action: "compare_states"
    state1: "entities_before"
    state2: "entities_after"
    store_as: "lightning_effect"
    name: "Compare before/after states"

  # Print comparison
  - action: "print_state_comparison"
    variable_name: "lightning_effect"
    name: "Show lightning effect results"
```

#### JSON Data Extraction

```yaml
steps:
  - action: "execute_rcon_with_capture"
    command: "data get entity @e[name=TestZombie,limit=1]"
    store_as: "zombie_data"

  - action: "print_stored_state"
    variable_name: "zombie_data"
    name: "Print raw zombie data"

  # Note: JSONPath extraction requires additional setup
  - action: "extract_with_jsonpath"
    source_variable: "zombie_data"
    json_path: "$.Health"
    store_as: "zombie_health"
    name: "Extract health value using JSONPath"
```

== Backend Types

=== Mineflayer Backend (Recommended)

For realistic player simulation and full plugin testing:

```yaml
backend: "mineflayer"
```

Features:
* Realistic player behavior simulation
* Chat message capture and processing
* Entity interaction and targeting
* Inventory and equipment management
* Block placement and breaking simulation

Advantages:
* Most realistic testing environment
* Tests actual plugin event handlers
* Captures player feedback and chat responses

=== RCON Backend

For server command-focused testing:

```yaml
backend: "rcon"
```

Features:
* Direct server command execution
* Data query and manipulation
* Server state inspection

Use Cases:
* Testing server-side plugin functionality
* Administrative command testing
* Performance testing

=== Mock Backend

For unit testing without external dependencies:

```yaml
backend: "mock"
```

Features:

```

=== Cooldown Testing

Test plugin cooldown functionality:

```yaml
name: "Cooldown Behavior Test"
description: "Test that cooldown blocks immediate reuse"

setup:
  - action: "execute_rcon_command"
    command: "op test_player"
    name: "Grant operator privileges"

  - action: "clear_cooldown"
    player: "test_player"
    name: "Clear any existing cooldown"

steps:
  # Use ability to trigger cooldown
  - action: "execute_player_command"
    player: "test_player"
    command: "/ability 1"
    name: "Use ability to start cooldown"

  - action: "wait"
    duration: 500
    name: "Brief wait"

  # Try to use ability again (should be blocked)
  - action: "execute_player_command"
    player: "test_player"
    command: "/ability 1"
    name: "Attempt ability during cooldown"

  # Wait for cooldown to expire
  - action: "set_cooldown"
    player: "test_player"
    duration: 3000
    name: "Set test cooldown for 3 seconds"

  - action: "execute_player_command"
    player: "test_player"
    command: "/ability 1"
    name: "Use ability after cooldown expires"

cleanup:
  - action: "execute_rcon_command"
    command: "deop test_player"
    name: "Remove operator privileges"
```

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Services not available:**
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.pilaf.yml ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.pilaf.yml logs

# Restart services
./stop-pilaf-services.sh
./start-pilaf-services.sh
```

**YAML parsing errors:**
- Check YAML syntax using online validators
