== Core Topics

Deep dive into Pilaf internals and implementation details.

=== Components

* link:story-runner.html[StoryRunner] - Test execution engine
* link:backends.html[Backend Architecture] - RCON and Mineflayer implementations

=== Key Concepts

==== Variable Storage

Store step results and reference them later:

[source,javascript]
----
// Store result
{ action: 'get_player_location', player: 'p', store_as: 'pos' }

// Reference stored value
{ action: 'calculate_distance', from: '{pos}', to: '{new_pos}' }
----

==== Backend Pooling

Pilaf maintains a pool of backend connections:

* `backends.rcon` - Single RCON connection
* `backends.players` - Map of username → MineflayerBackend

==== Resource Lifecycle

. Setup → Connect backends, create bots
. Steps → Execute actions using backends
. Teardown → Disconnect everything (ALWAYS runs)
